# Review Rating Prediction
This project is created as a part of the final Capstone project at NYC Data Science Academy December 2017.

The objective of the project was to predict the sentiment / star rating based on only customer reviews by applying the well known dataset from Yelp. 

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks and a PP presentation. The yelp_processing.ipynb is used to prepare the reviews to learn different NLP techniques, including Bag-of-Words, Word2vec and Doc2vec. 
In the yelp_pml.ipynb we build different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for binary and multinomial classification. Also, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to visualize the word embedding models from last LTSM layer of the CNN model.
